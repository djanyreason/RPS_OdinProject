This repository is the Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project Foundations course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

This project is an introductory javascript project with a minimal HTML and CSS layer. The webpage plays a best-of-9 game of Rock Paper Scissors. Once either the player or computer has 5 wins, the game ends and the page must be reloaded to play again.

The website can be seen live at https://djanyreason.github.io/RPS_OdinProject/
